## New website to book treks in Karnataka

Karnataka Forest department launched a new website [Aranya Vihaara](https://aranyavihaara.karnataka.gov.in/) on [3rd of October, 2024](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-reopens-trekking-with-new-online-portal-aranya-vihaara/articleshow/113967359.cms) to replace the old [Karnataka Eco Tourism](https://www.karnatakaecotourism.com/) [does not allowing booking permits] website.

## But the experience of looking for treks is a pain.

One has to first select the district in which the trek lies and then select the trek. 

But one might not even know which trek lies in which district.

So this extension lets you quickly select a trek without having to select the district.

## Install it from the Chrome web store
